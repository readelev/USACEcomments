# USACE Public Commentary
Looking for stories in public comments on EPA/USACE projects.

## Background

### Basics

Deger Turan's thesis on citizen participation in governance provides a good background for the history of public commentary and the issues with current systems/political organizations that have fallen behind trying to process enormous quantities of data, as technology has made it easier for citizens to weigh in.

### EPA, NEPA Compliance

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law on January 1, 1970. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making a decision. "Actions" can include anything from deciding on permit applications to building roads to other public facilities like the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In order to comply with NEPA, every federal agency is bound by differing, specific requirements. [A list of implementing procedures can be found here.](https://ceq.doe.gov/nepa_contacts/agency_implementing_procedures.html) Agencies submit an Environmental Assessment (EA) to determine whether a federal would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

From the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [website](https://www.epa.gov/nepa): "EPA is charged under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act to review the environmental impact statements (EIS) of other federal agencies and to comment on the adequacy and the acceptability of the environmental impacts of the proposed action."

### Content and Procedure

The Environmental Assessment is a public document meant to provide evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI).

A Draft EA is publicized through notices in newspapers and clearning houses. Then, there's a 15-day review period while the document is made available for public commentary. After this, the lead action agency responds to any comment and certifies with a FONSI or a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS.

### The Devil is in the Details

There are an astounding number of rules and regulations agencies must follow in order to fully comply with NEPA. Here are some highlights:

* Following the 15-day review period, the agency must respond to every single comment received for the final EA to be valid. 

## Relevancy

### Dakota Access Pipeline

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used an environmental assessment prepared by the pipeline's developer, Dakota Access LLC, to approve the 1,134-mile project.

From ICN: "The 1,134-mile pipeline would carry approximately 500,000 barrels of crude per day from North Dakota to Illinois along a route that did not originally pass near the Standing Rock reservation, the documents show. After the company rerouted the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just a half-mile upstream of the reservation, the tribe complained that the Army Corps did not consider threats to its water supply and cultural heritage."

Based on the EA prepared by Dakota Access, the US Army Corps of Engineers determined a Finding of No Significant Impact, despite serious environmental and safety objections raisd by officials at the U.S. EPA, the Department of the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

The Camp of the Sacred Stones accuses the project of breaching multiple federal laws, including:

* Article 2 of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, which guarantees that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe enjoy the "undistrubed use and occupation" of their permanent homeland, the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.

* Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice mandates that agencies must determine if proposed projects disproportionately impact Tribal or other minority communities.

* The Pipeline Safety Act and Clean Water Act requires the emergency plan estimate the maximum possible spill should the pipeline fail over the Ogallala Aquifer. The DAPL has refused to release this information to the tribe.

* NEPA (discussed above) which requires federal agencies consider the full environmental consequences of proposed actions.

* Executive Order 13007 on the Protection of Sacred Sites requires agencies avoid adversly affecting physical integrity of historic ceremony sites and burial grounds.

### So what?

In their letter to the USACE, the EPA wrote that Dakota Access had failed to adequately reach out to minority and/or low income groups impacted by the projects, including the Standing Rock Tribe. Activists sight systematic issues: companies conducing EAs frequently fail to consult tribes and rarely conduct full Environmental Impact Statements when the proposed action involves oil production or crosses tribal land.

## Data

My goal is to sift through public commentary data available on OpenData.gov to see if there's merit to claims of systematic injustice and/or inadequacies on behalf of the EPA. Some initial questions:

1. How frequently do agencies conduct a full EIS on projects that (a) cross tribal lands and (2) involve oil? Is there a statistical difference between how often these types of projects versus other types of projects get a full EIS?

2. For projects that involve tribal lands, how often does the company advertise the public commentary period for its Draft EA in native publications?

3. How often do agencies determine a proposed project disproportionaty affects a Tribal community or other minority community (per Executive Order 12898)?

4. How often as the Corps denied permits based on EO 13007, on Protection of Sacred Sites?
